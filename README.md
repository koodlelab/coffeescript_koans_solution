# CoffeeScript Koans Solution

This project is mainly to learn CoffeeScript through CoffeeScript Koans provided in https://github.com/sleepyfox/coffeescript-koans
# Getting Started

This project requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - if you haven't already installed it I would recommend installing the Node Version Manager - [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - and using that to install Node.
	
Install dependencies by using npm from the command line:
	
	npm install

# Running the Koans

Run the tests with [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) on the command line:

	npm test
